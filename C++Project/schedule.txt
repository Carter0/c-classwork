Our previous checkpoints were...


Checkpoint 1
___ Find a way to create basic levels that the player can move around in.
___ Find a way to implement player input for the game
___ Create a basic layout for classes and header files needed to make the game. 



and we have completed all of those. We have a solid class layout for everything in our project, and we have figured out how to use SDL to render objects to the screen.
