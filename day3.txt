Input/Output streams

Included with IOStream 
cerr 
cout
cin

For Files
ifstream - read from file
ofstream - write to file 

<< >> stream out and in operators 


Also, getline function 
getline (stream, string)
	- reads in an entire line  


Converting string to int 
include sstream
get an input string with getline

stringstream sstr(numbers) -> makes a stream from a string
int x;
sstr >> x;

cout << "the number is " << c << endl;


for many ints and not just one
while (sstr >> x) {
	cout << "the number is " << x << endl;
}


to reset the sstr, there might be a reset fx




for the ifstream example 

int main () {
	ifstream infile ("input.txt");
	string str;
	while(getline (infile, str)) {
		cout << str << endl;
	}
}



for loop shenanigans
	vector <int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	for (vector<int>::size_type i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
		cout << v[i] << endl;
	}

	OR

	for (int e : v) {
		cout << e << endl;
	}
