We got all of our assets from 

https://opengameart.org/ and https://www.gameart2d.com/freebies.html.

So all of our assets are open source.

Specifically, we got our Santa sprite from Game Art 2d as well as all the animations for the sprite. 

All the other assets are from opengameart.org. 


We watched many tutorials on SFML. Specifically, I spent a lot of time going through SFML documentation online and watching tutorial videos on SFML too. 

Also, I spent some time trying to configure makesfiles for SFML. I learned a lot about how makefiles work.
