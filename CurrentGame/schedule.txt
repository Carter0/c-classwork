Final
___ Have a complete level with enemies and platforms. 
___ Have a start and game over screen. 
___ Have satisfying player movement and combat. 



So, we have not managed to complete most of the goals that we set out for ourselves. 

We do have platforms in the game and we sort of have enemies. We have object in the game where if the player touches them they die. 

Player movement and jumping does work. But I wouldn't call them satisfying. 

And finally we do not have a start and game over screen. 

I think there are too many things that went wrong with the project to count, but if I had to list a few. First, we should have just used SDL with the terminal instead of SFML with visual studio. That way development and turn in would have been much easier. 

Also, our group members had a misunderstanding of exactly what the project was supposed to be.
