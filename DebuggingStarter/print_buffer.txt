Errors found with Valgrind

    1. Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s) at line 18.        
        There were multiple issues with this line of code. The main one is that it is deleting an array that was never initialized. In order to fix the problem I created a new char array and set it equal to buffer in the constructor. 

    2. This also fixed the mismatched free delete error valgrind was outputting. 
    
    3. There was also a similar error to #1. And simply filling in the constuctor fixed that issue too. 
    I tried inputting negative numbers, and strings, and decimals, but I found no other memory error no matter how many times I inputted data.
