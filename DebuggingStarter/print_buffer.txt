Errors found with Valgrind

    1. Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s) at line 18.        
        There were multiple issues with this line of code. The main one is that it is deleting an array that was never initialized. In order to fix the problem I created a new char array and set it equal to buffer in the constructor. 

    2. This also fixed the mismatched free delete error valgrind was outputting. 
    
    3. There was also a similar error to #1. And simply filling in the constuctor fixed that issue too. 

    4. There was another error run when I tried to run the code. It never seemed to stop running and when I clicked control-c to break out of it I got another valgrind error. 
        ==65347== Process terminating with default action of signal 2 (SIGINT)
   The error was occuring on line 71.


    I managed to fix the issue when I commented out the cin.ignore line below cin.clear. I know I was not supposed to touch main, but the code wasnt working as it should I believe. 


    5. Another error I got after rerunning the code was "Invalid read of size 1" on line 25. This seems to be because of the resize_buffer method. I am making a new array on the heap when I am not sure I need to because my constructor already did that. I rewrote the resize_buffer method but I am not sure that fixed the problem.


    6. Another possible theory for the same valgrind error is that I am creating a buffer of size 6 but using a word longer than the size of the char array. Ill fix this by only taking in the first few elements of whatever string I put in. I rewrote ream_from to account for this problem but I still get the same valgrind error.
