Of the two functions which both use different ways of accessing elements in a vector, bracket access
notation seems to be faster according to gprof.


Some relevant information...

Firstly, here is the time for the at notation

    33.3                outPutAt(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >) [3]


Secondly, here is the time for Bracket notation

    4.8    0.00    0.00       1         outPutBr(std::vector<int, std::allocator<int> >) [13]



This seems to be because at() because at() does out of bounds checking whereas bracket notation does not.
